# Crypto-Currency Exchange Platform

This repository contains the my code developed during a specialisation course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. The project is a crypto-currency exchange platform, which demonstrates various OOP techniques and concepts.

## Project Overview

The project is a crypto-currency exchange platform built incrementally over five courses. The platform showcases a variety of programming techniques, from basic control flow and input/output to file parsing, object-oriented techniques, and user interaction in the console.

### Key Features
- Object-Oriented Design: The platform is built using OOP principles, with well-defined classes and modular design.
- Data Handling: Efficient handling and representation of different data types.
- Interactive Console: User interaction is managed through a console interface.
- File Parsing: Ability to read and process data from files.
- Control Flow: Implementation of various control flow mechanisms to manage program execution.

## Building the Project.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-exchange-platform.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd merkelrex
```

3. Compile the files.
```
g++ main.cpp MerkelMain.cpp OrderBookEntry.cpp OrderBook.cpp CSVReader.cpp Wallet.cpp -o output
```

4. Run the output file.
```
./output.out
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the crypto-currency exchange platform.
